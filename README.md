# BLDC Motor 

A mostly 3D printed outrunner brushless DC motor with 9 slots and 12 poles, wound in a Y configuration.

If I wanted the most RPM or torque I would've bought a bldc, this is mostly just a model. In the future i'll use it to test a driver I hope to make.

Features:
- Shaft held by set screw
- N52 magnets
- Press fit 3d printed parts
- Slot for wires
- Removeable base
