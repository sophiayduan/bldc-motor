# July 30th: Quick project

**Total time spent: 5h**


Designed a proper (mostly 3d printed) bldc, not the most practical, but it is mostly for learning purposes and test a motor driver I hope to build in the future. 
This was my second time designing oen so it was much faster, this time however it is built for performance and not just a model.
