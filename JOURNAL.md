Total time: 6.5h


# July 30th: Quick project

**Total time spent: 0.5h**

Planning: 
I'll be using 9 slots / 16 poles, it'll be a pain to wind by hand but I'm trying to have decent torque and rpm at the same time.
The shaft will be held by a set screw, and all the 3D printed parts will be press fit.

I also referenced my first 3d printed bldc, it had many many flaws I hope to fix with this design:
- Non existant pressfit
- Shaft is held by friction
- Large for no reason
- Poor CAD
- Circular magnets

# July 31st: Finished
**Total time spent: 6h**
Today I finished CADing the entire project, using M2 threaded insert (same as my other project) and some small ball bearings. 
The hardest part was getting the correct dimensions for my stator teeth and rotor, I need to optimize the gap between the magnets, the rotor/stator air gap, keeping the stator teeth reasonable for me to wind by hand and that parts I could find on aliexpress. 

I think I managed to fix all the issues I wanted to tackle with this design.
