# July 30th: Quick project

**Total time spent: 0.5h**

Planning: 
I'll be using 9 slots / 12 poles, it'll be a pain to wind by hand but I'm trying to have decent torque and rpm at the same time.
The shaft will be held by a set screw, and all the 3D printed parts will be press fit.

I also referenced my first 3d printed bldc, it had many many flaws I hope to fix with this design:
- Non existant pressfit
- Shaft is held by friction
- Large for no reason
- Poor CAD
- Circular magnets
